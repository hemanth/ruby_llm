description: Contribute to the RubyLLM AI framework - set up the repo, run and record specs, work on conversations, individual AI operations, providers, protocols, Rails integration, and docs. Use when fixing a bug, building a feature, writing specs, or changing documentation in the RubyLLM codebase.

# Contributing to RubyLLM

Read AGENTS.md at the repo root first: it has the ground rules, the command table, and the architecture constraints that `archspec check` enforces. This skill adds the step-by-step recipes.

## Choose the layer

The public API covers conversations (`Chat`, `Message`, `Tool`, `Agent`, structured output, streaming, and loop control) and individual operations (`paint`, `animate`, `speak`, `transcribe`, `ocr`, `moderate`, `embed`, and `rerank`). Both connect to services through providers and protocols: providers supply endpoints, authentication, catalogs, and protocol selection; protocols implement formats and their dialects.

Model resolution, configuration, accounting, instrumentation, batches, and provider resources support the framework as a whole. Keep independent operations independent of `Chat`. Rails integration adds Active Record, Active Storage, Hotwire, jobs, and generators around the same Ruby API; it does not define a second conversation API.

## The fast loop

```bash
bundle exec rspec --tag ~live          # unit tests only, no keys, seconds not minutes
bundle exec rspec spec/ruby_llm/chat_spec.rb:42   # one example
overcommit --run                       # what the commit hook will run
```

Run the fast loop while developing. Run `overcommit --run` before declaring anything done: it runs RuboCop (auto-correct), Flay (duplication), archspec (architecture), and the unit suite, and the commit fails if any of them do.

## Working with cassettes

Specs tagged `:live` replay recorded provider traffic from `spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes`. The cassette name derives from the example's full description, so renaming an example orphans its cassette.

To re-record after changing request shapes:

```bash
rake vcr:record[openai]            # deletes that provider's cassettes, reruns the suite
rake vcr:record[openai,anthropic]  # several providers
rake vcr:record[all]               # everything (long, needs many keys)
```

Recording needs real API keys in `.env`. To re-record a single spec, delete its cassette file and run the spec with the provider's key set.

Rules that bite:

- A failing `:live` example deletes its own cassette on purpose. Do not "fix" a red spec by restoring the cassette; fix the code, then re-record.
- Review every new or changed cassette for leaked keys and personal data before committing. The pre-commit hook runs gitleaks, but eyes first.
- A spec that can neither replay (no cassette) nor record (no key) skips with a message naming the env var it needs. That is expected on a fork without keys.

## Adding or changing a chat option

1. Add `with_x` to `lib/ruby_llm/chat.rb` (chainable, returns `self`).
2. Add the matching bare `x` class macro to `lib/ruby_llm/agent.rb`. The archspec build fails without it.
3. Thread the option through the `Provider` contract, never by referencing a concrete provider or protocol from `Chat`.
4. Implement per protocol in `lib/ruby_llm/protocols/*` (`render_*` for request payloads, `parse_*` for responses).
5. Spec it in `spec/ruby_llm/chat_<x>_spec.rb`; add live coverage over the matrix in `spec/support/models_to_test.rb` when providers differ.
6. Document it on the matching page in `docs/_core_features/`.

## Working on an individual AI operation

1. Start with the public operation and its typed result. Keep the shared RubyLLM names consistent across providers.
2. Route service calls through the `Provider` contract and registered protocols. Keep request rendering, response parsing, and format quirks in protocols.
3. Reuse model resolution, configuration, usage accounting, and instrumentation where applicable. Preserve the operation's streaming or job lifecycle.
4. Test public behavior and protocol translation at their respective layers. Document the operation in its feature guide and keep its Getting Started example short.

## Adding a provider

For smaller or emerging providers, ship a community gem instead of a core PR (the core bar is high, see CONTRIBUTING.md):

```bash
bundle exec ruby_llm provider-gem Acme --api-base https://api.acme.ai/v1
```

That scaffolds a complete gem with specs and CI. For an approved core provider:

```bash
script/generate-provider acme
```

Then make it real:

1. `lib/ruby_llm/providers/acme.rb` declares auth, API base, and which protocols it speaks (`protocol :chat_completions, ...`). If the provider has its own wire format, that format is a new protocol under `lib/ruby_llm/protocols/`, not code inside the provider.
2. Replace the scaffold's example capabilities with the provider's real ones, and identify the model-catalog source.
3. Register the provider in `lib/ruby_llm.rb` (the entrypoint is the only place concrete providers get wired in).
4. Record cassettes covering normal chat and streaming chat at minimum.
5. Document configuration in `docs/_getting_started/configuration-providers.md`.

## Rails work

- Rails specs run against the dummy app in `spec/dummy`; `acts_as_chat` and `acts_as_message` live in `lib/ruby_llm/active_record/`.
- The Rails integration builds on the domain layer and the `Provider` contract only. It converts records with `to_llm`/`from_llm`; plain-Ruby objects never define those.
- Preserve the Ruby conversation API on records, Active Storage attachment support, and the persisted message lifecycle used by Hotwire streaming and background jobs. Individual operations remain callable directly from Rails services and jobs.
- Generators live in `lib/generators/ruby_llm/` (install, chat_ui, agent, tool, schema, provider, and upgrade when the last release changed the schema). Their specs are tagged `:generator` and excluded from the pre-commit run; run them explicitly with `bundle exec rspec --tag generator`.
- Check Rails-version compatibility across the matrix: `bundle exec appraisal rails-7.1 rspec` through `rails-8.1`.

## Docs work

- Pages live in `docs/` under `_getting_started`, `_core_features`, `_advanced`, and `_reference`. Preview with `docs/bin/serve.sh`.
- Voice: Rails guides. Second person, present tense, show the code before explaining it, motivate each feature with the problem it solves in one sentence. No em dashes, no hype, no "simply".
- Lead with short, working public API examples. Show how features combine when it helps the reader build something. Keep the title, description, and "After reading this guide" opening; introduce concepts before adding a summary table.
- Front-matter `description` becomes the page's llms.txt entry and social card text: one compelling sentence, no `&`, `<`, or `>`.
- Cross-link with `{% link _collection/page.md %}`, never hard-coded URLs.
- `docs/_reference/available-models.md` is generated; never edit it.

## Before opening the PR

1. `overcommit --run` passes.
2. New behavior has specs; changed provider behavior has re-recorded cassettes, reviewed for secrets.
3. Public API changes are documented in `docs/` and have RDoc.
4. The PR does one thing, references its approved issue, and explains the problem before the solution.
