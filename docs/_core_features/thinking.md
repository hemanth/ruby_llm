After reading this guide, you will know:

* How to control extended thinking with `with_thinking`
* How effort and budget are sent to providers
* How to access thinking output in responses and streams
* How to persist thinking data with ActiveRecord

## What is Extended Thinking?

Extended Thinking gives supported models more time and a larger computation budget to deliberate before answering. It can improve results on multi-step tasks like coding, math, and logic, at the expense of latency and cost. Some providers can also return a thinking trace or signature alongside the final answer.

## Controlling Extended Thinking

Call `with_thinking` without options to enable thinking with the current model's registered controls:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: 'claude-opus-4-5').with_thinking
```

RubyLLM resolves those controls when it builds the request, so it follows later model changes and fallbacks. The registry may select an effort, a token budget, a provider toggle, or no request option for a model that always thinks. If the registry does not know how to enable thinking for the selected model, RubyLLM raises an `ArgumentError` instead of guessing.

When the registry lists several controls, RubyLLM prefers an explicit default, then a provider toggle, then `medium` effort when available, then the smallest positive token budget the model accepts. Each protocol then sends what its provider needs. Claude never turns thinking on from an effort alone, so RubyLLM adds the thinking block that generation takes. See [Provider Notes](#provider-notes).

Pass keyword options or a Hash to configure thinking explicitly:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: 'claude-opus-4-5')
  .with_thinking(effort: :high, budget: 8000)

response = chat.ask("What is 15 * 23?")

response.thinking&.text
response.thinking&.signature
response.content
```

`response.thinking.text` combines the visible thinking text. RubyLLM also keeps the individual signed and encrypted blocks for later turns. When you restore a conversation, keep the complete messages instead of rebuilding thinking from `text` and `signature` alone.

Thinking stays with the provider that produced it. When `with_model` moves a chat to another provider, earlier turns replay without their thinking, because no provider can verify another provider's signature. The messages themselves keep it.

Pass `effort`, `budget`, or both:

```ruby
chat.with_thinking(effort: :low)
chat.with_thinking(budget: 10_000)
chat.with_thinking({ effort: :high })
chat.with_thinking(effort: :none)
```

Pass `false` to disable thinking:

```ruby
chat.with_thinking(false)
```

Disabling is model-specific too. RubyLLM sends the registered off control and raises an `ArgumentError` when the model does not expose one. Passing `nil` is invalid.

### Effort and Budget

Use `effort` to pick a qualitative depth (`:low`, `:medium`, `:high`) and `budget` for models that accept a token cap.

RubyLLM sends `effort` and `budget` exactly as provided, and never rewrites a value to one the registry believes a model takes. Check your provider's docs for supported values. When a model does not accept the value you picked, the request fails with the provider's own error, which names the parameter and usually lists the values it takes.

### Display

Some providers let you choose how much of the thinking comes back with the response. Pass `display:` and RubyLLM forwards the value in the provider's request shape:

```ruby
chat.with_thinking(effort: :high, display: :summarized)  # a summary of the thinking
chat.with_thinking(effort: :high, display: :omitted)     # think, but return no thinking text
```

## Streaming with Thinking

Thinking content is delivered alongside normal content in streaming chunks:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: 'claude-opus-5')
  .with_thinking(effort: :medium, display: :summarized)

chat.ask("Solve this step by step: What is 127 * 43?") do |chunk|
  print chunk.thinking&.text
  print chunk.content
end
```

Some providers only expose thinking in the final response. In those cases, `response.thinking` is populated after the stream completes, and `chunk.thinking` stays empty.

## ActiveRecord Integration

When using `acts_as_chat` and `acts_as_message`, thinking content is persisted with the message while thinking-token accounting is stored in RubyLLM's internal usage ledger:

```ruby
# Migration (generated automatically with new installs)
# t.text :thinking_text
# t.text :thinking_signature

response = chat_record.ask("Explain quantum entanglement")
response.thinking&.text
response.tokens.thinking
```

`tokens.thinking` reports reasoning work separately. `tokens.output` is already the billable output bucket, so do not add `tokens.thinking` to it when calculating costs. When a model has distinct reasoning-token pricing, the cost is exposed separately as `response.cost.thinking`.

Apps upgrading from 1.16 get the thinking columns from the [2.0 upgrade](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm/blob/v2.0.0/docs/_reference/upgrading.md).

The generated schema also preserves the complete thinking blocks when you reload a conversation. Upgrading cannot recover blocks that an older version already discarded.

## Provider Notes

- Anthropic sends each option to its own parameter: `budget` becomes a thinking budget, `effort` becomes Claude's effort setting, and `display` chooses how much thinking text comes back. Effort alone never turns thinking on, so RubyLLM always sends a thinking block with it. Generations that take a budget (Opus 4.5, Opus and Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet and Haiku 4.5) use the `budget:` you set, or one sized from the effort with the levels Bedrock publishes: 1024 for low, 40000 for medium, 63999 for high, capped under `max_tokens`. Generations without a budget option (Opus 4.7 and later, Sonnet 5, Fable 5) think adaptively and decide how much to think. `with_thinking(false)` sends a disabled block on every generation. Newer Claude models hide their thinking text, so pass `display: :summarized` to read it.
- Bedrock thinking params are model-dependent. Claude models on Bedrock only take a token budget, so RubyLLM converts `effort` into the budget level the model advertises. Pass `budget` to set the exact number of tokens.
- Gemini 2.5 uses a token budget; Gemini 3 uses effort levels.
- OpenAI reasoning models accept `effort`, return an encrypted signature, and only return thinking text when you pass `display: :summarized`, which asks the Responses API for a reasoning summary.
- Perplexity's Agent API folds reasoning into the answer text and returns no separate thinking.
- Mistral sends `effort` as `reasoning_effort` for every model. Its reasoning models take `high` and `none`, and models without reasoning reject the parameter. Mistral has no thinking budget, so `budget` has no effect.
- DeepSeek accepts a wider range of effort levels than most providers and has no thinking budget. Its error lists the levels a model takes.
- Cohere reasoning models think by default. `with_thinking(budget:)` caps the thinking tokens, and `with_thinking(effort: :none)` turns the default off. Models without reasoning reject the request. Cohere returns thinking text but no signature, and reports no separate thinking token count.
- Ollama and GPUStack local-model thinking controls vary by backend and model. RubyLLM does not translate them; pass backend params explicitly with `with_provider_options`.
- Ollama does not report thinking token counts.
