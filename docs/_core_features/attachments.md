After reading this guide, you will know:

* How to attach images, video, audio, text files, and PDFs to a message.
* How to send local files and remote URLs through the `with:` parameter.
* How RubyLLM detects file types automatically.
* How to trade tokens for detail with `resolution:`.
* When to use in-prompt attachments versus provider-managed file IDs.

## Attaching Files

Send files alongside your question with `with:`. Choose a model that accepts the file's input type; the [Models]({% link _reference/available-models.md %}) page lets you filter by input modality.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: "{{ site.models.gemini_current }}")
response = chat.ask "What happens in this video?", with: "demo.mp4"
puts response.content
```

RubyLLM can upload large local attachments automatically. To upload once and reuse a file across requests, see [Files]({% link _core_features/files.md %}).

### Attachment Security

String sources are instructions to read a local file or fetch a URL. Only pass paths and URLs that your application trusts and the current user is authorized to access. RubyLLM does not restrict them to a directory or public network addresses. Reading can begin during attachment construction to detect the file type.

Passing an unchecked upload parameter to `with:` or `RubyLLM::Attachment.new` lets a user supply a URL or server-side path instead of a file. This can expose internal services through server-side request forgery (SSRF), or disclose local files when their contents are sent to a model. The same restriction applies to file inputs for standalone operations such as `RubyLLM.upload` and `RubyLLM.transcribe`.

For browser uploads, validate that each value is an actual uploaded file before passing it to RubyLLM. The [Rails persistence example]({% link _advanced/rails-persistence.md %}#attachments-and-structured-output) shows this check. For stored files, load attachments through records the current user is authorized to access.

### Working with Images

Vision-capable models can analyze images, answer questions about visual content, and even compare multiple images.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.openai_vision }}')

response = chat.ask "Describe this logo.", with: "path/to/ruby_logo.png"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "What kind of architecture is shown here?", with: "https://example.com/eiffel_tower.jpg"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "Compare the user interfaces in these two screenshots.", with: ["screenshot_v1.png", "screenshot_v2.png"]
puts response.content
```

### Working with Videos

Ask a video-capable model about local videos or URLs:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.gemini_current }}')
response = chat.ask "What happens in this video?", with: "path/to/demo.mp4"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "Summarize the main events in this video.", with: "https://example.com/demo_video.mp4"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "Analyze these files for visual content.", with: ["diagram.png", "demo.mp4", "notes.txt"]
puts response.content
```

### Working with Audio

Audio-capable models can answer questions about a recording:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.openai_audio }}')

response = chat.ask "Please transcribe this meeting recording.", with: "path/to/meeting.mp3"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "What were the main action items discussed?"
puts response.content
```

For a transcript without a conversation, use [Audio Transcription]({% link _core_features/audio-transcription.md %}).

### Working with Text Files

You can provide text files directly to models for analysis, summarization, or question answering. This works with any text-based format including plain text, code files, CSV, JSON, and more.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.anthropic_current }}')

response = chat.ask "Summarize the key points in this document.", with: "path/to/document.txt"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "Explain what this Ruby file does.", with: "app/models/user.rb"
puts response.content
```

### Working with PDFs

Ask about a report, manual, or research paper with a model that accepts PDFs:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.anthropic_newest }}')

response = chat.ask "Summarize the key findings in this research paper.", with: "path/to/paper.pdf"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "What are the terms and conditions outlined here?", with: "https://example.com/terms.pdf"
puts response.content

response = chat.ask "Based on section 3 of this document, what is the warranty period?", with: "manual.pdf"
puts response.content
```

Documents still have to fit the model's context limit, even when uploaded separately.

### Working with Office Documents

Word documents, presentations, and spreadsheets attach the same way when the selected model and provider support them:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.openai_current }}')

response = chat.ask "What is the project codename in this document?", with: "brief.docx"
response = chat.ask "Which region had the highest revenue?", with: "sales.xlsx"
```

Providers without native document support raise `RubyLLM::UnsupportedAttachmentError`. Convert those files to PDF or text first.

### Choosing the Media Resolution

Small print and dense tables need more detail than a photo of a cat. Build the attachment yourself and set `resolution:` to control how many tokens the model spends on it:

```ruby
page = RubyLLM::Attachment.new("page-3.png", resolution: :ultra_high)
chat.ask "Where is the revenue figure?", with: page
```

The values are `:low`, `:medium`, `:high`, and `:ultra_high`. Each attachment keeps its own setting, so one message can mix a high-detail page with low-detail thumbnails. Leave it unset to use the provider's default. Persisted chats keep the setting, so later turns and background jobs send the same detail.

Gemini applies the setting to images, videos, and PDFs, sending `:high` for videos and PDFs when you ask for `:ultra_high`. OpenAI, Azure, OpenRouter, and xAI apply it to images, sending `:low` as low detail and anything higher as high detail. Other providers ignore it, since it is a quality hint rather than a requirement.

### Automatic File Type Detection

RubyLLM automatically detects file types based on extensions and content, so you can pass files directly without specifying the type:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: '{{ site.models.gemini_current }}')

response = chat.ask "What's in this file?", with: "path/to/document.pdf"

# Multiple files of different types
response = chat.ask "Analyze these files", with: [
  "diagram.png",
  "report.pdf",
  "meeting_notes.txt",
  "recording.mp3"
]
```

**Recognized file types:**

- **Images:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .bmp
- **Videos:** .mp4, .mov, .avi, .webm
- **Audio:** .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .ogg, .flac
- **Documents:** .pdf, .txt, .md, .csv, .json, .xml
- **Code:** .rb, .py, .js, .html, .css (and many others)

## Next Steps

* [Chat]({% link _core_features/chat.md %}) - continue a conversation about your files.
* [Files]({% link _core_features/files.md %}) - upload files once and reuse them by provider-managed ID.
* [Advanced Request Control]({% link _core_features/chat-request-control.md %}) - control model requests.
* [Audio Transcription]({% link _core_features/audio-transcription.md %}) - turn recordings into transcripts.
