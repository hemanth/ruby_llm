After reading this guide, you will know:

* How to store prompt templates in `app/prompts`.
* How to render templates with `RubyLLM.render_prompt`.
* How locals, nested paths, and `.txt.erb` filenames work.
* How to share pieces of a prompt with partials.
* How rendered prompts fit into chats and agents.
* Which errors to expect when a prompt file is missing.

## Rendering a Prompt

`RubyLLM.render_prompt` renders a local ERB template and returns the rendered string. It does not call a model or add anything to a chat by itself.

Create `app/prompts/support/instructions.txt.erb`:

```erb
You are a support assistant for <%= product_name %>.

The current customer is <%= customer_name %>.
Answer with concise, practical steps.
```

Render it with keyword locals:

```ruby
instructions = RubyLLM.render_prompt(
  "support/instructions",
  product_name: "BillingHub",
  customer_name: current_user.name
)

chat = RubyLLM.chat
chat.with_instructions(instructions)
chat.ask("How do I update my invoice email?")
```

`RubyLLM.render_prompt("support/instructions")` resolves to:

```text
app/prompts/support/instructions.txt.erb
```

In Rails apps, the path is relative to `Rails.root`. Outside Rails, it is relative to the current working directory.

## Static Prompts

Prompts do not need locals. For example, `app/prompts/reviewer.txt.erb`:

```erb
You are a careful code reviewer. Focus on correctness, security, and missing tests.
```

```ruby
instructions = RubyLLM.render_prompt("reviewer")
chat.with_instructions(instructions)
```

## Locals

Every keyword argument passed to `render_prompt` is available in the ERB template. Create `app/prompts/messages/welcome.txt.erb`:

```erb
Welcome <%= name %>.

Your plan is <%= plan_name %>.
```

```ruby
RubyLLM.render_prompt(
  "messages/welcome",
  name: "Ada",
  plan_name: "Pro"
)
# => "Welcome Ada.\n\nYour plan is Pro.\n"
```

If the template references a local you did not pass, ERB raises an error while rendering.

## Nested Paths and Extensions

Prompt names can include nested directories:

```ruby
RubyLLM.render_prompt("work_assistant/instructions", display_name: "Ada")
```

This renders:

```text
app/prompts/work_assistant/instructions.txt.erb
```

You can also pass the full filename:

```ruby
RubyLLM.render_prompt("work_assistant/instructions.txt.erb", display_name: "Ada")
```

RubyLLM prompt templates use `.txt.erb`.

## Prompts in Engines

`RubyLLM::Prompt.roots` is the ordered list of directories searched for prompt files, the same way `ActionView` searches view paths. The application's `app/prompts` is always first, so a gem or Rails engine can ship its own prompts by appending its directory in an initializer:

```ruby
# my_engine/lib/my_engine/engine.rb
module MyEngine
  class Engine < ::Rails::Engine
    initializer "my_engine.prompts" do
      RubyLLM::Prompt.roots << MyEngine::Engine.root.join("app/prompts")
    end
  end
end
```

An agent shipped by the engine then finds its prompt in the engine:

```text
my_engine/app/prompts/my_engine/chat_agent/instructions.txt.erb
```

Because the application root is searched first, a host app overrides any engine prompt by creating a file at the same relative path:

```text
app/prompts/my_engine/chat_agent/instructions.txt.erb
```

## Partials

Partials let you break a prompt into smaller files and reuse them across prompts. A partial is a prompt file whose name starts with an underscore. Create `app/prompts/work_assistant/_tone.txt.erb`:

```erb
Be warm and direct with <%= display_name %>.
```

Insert it with `render` from `app/prompts/work_assistant/instructions.txt.erb`:

```erb
<%= render "tone", display_name: display_name %>
<%= render "shared/safety" %>
```

`render "tone"` looks next to the current prompt only:

```text
app/prompts/work_assistant/_tone.txt.erb
```

From a top-level prompt such as `app/prompts/instructions.txt.erb`, the same call finds `app/prompts/_tone.txt.erb`.

`render "shared/safety"` looks in the prompt roots:

```text
app/prompts/shared/_safety.txt.erb
```

You can also pass the partial and its locals as a hash, the way Action View does:

```erb
<%= render partial: "tone", locals: { display_name: display_name } %>
```

Partials receive only the locals you pass. Nothing leaks from the outer template. Read an optional local through `local_assigns`, which works in prompts and partials alike:

```erb
Be warm and direct<% if local_assigns[:display_name] %> with <%= display_name %><% end %>.
```

A local whose name is not a valid Ruby variable name is available only through `local_assigns`.

If RubyLLM cannot find the partial file, it raises `RubyLLM::PromptNotFoundError`.

## Missing Prompts

If RubyLLM cannot find the prompt file, it raises `RubyLLM::PromptNotFoundError`:

```ruby
RubyLLM.render_prompt("missing")
# => raises RubyLLM::PromptNotFoundError
```

## Using Rendered Prompts in Chat

Use rendered prompts anywhere you would use a string:

```ruby
system_prompt = RubyLLM.render_prompt(
  "analysis/instructions",
  timezone: Time.zone.name,
  account_type: current_account.plan_name
)

chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: "{{ site.models.default_chat }}")
chat.with_instructions(system_prompt)

response = chat.ask(
  RubyLLM.render_prompt("analysis/question", topic: params[:topic])
)
```

Prompt rendering is local string templating. For provider-side reuse of large stable prompt prefixes, see [Prompt Caching]({% link _core_features/prompt-caching.md %}).

## Using Prompts with Agents

Agents build on the same prompt renderer. Named agents automatically render their conventional prompt when it exists:

```ruby
class WorkAssistant < RubyLLM::Agent
  chat_model Chat
end
```

For `WorkAssistant`, RubyLLM looks for:

```text
app/prompts/work_assistant/instructions.txt.erb
```

If the file exists, it is used as the agent's system instructions. If it does not exist and the agent has no `instructions` macro, the agent starts without system instructions.

Reference the prompt explicitly when the file is required; RubyLLM then raises `RubyLLM::PromptNotFoundError` if it is missing:

```ruby
class WorkAssistant < RubyLLM::Agent
  chat_model Chat
  instructions { prompt("instructions") }
end
```

You can pass locals to the conventional prompt:

```ruby
class WorkAssistant < RubyLLM::Agent
  chat_model Chat

  instructions display_name: -> { chat.user.display_name_or_email }
end
```

For the full class-based conventions, see [Agents]({% link _advanced/agents.md %}#prompt-management-and-conventions).

## Safety Notes

ERB templates execute Ruby code, so prompt files should be trusted application code. Do not pass untrusted user input as the prompt name; keep prompt names as application-controlled constants or map user choices to known prompt names.

Locals are inserted exactly as rendered by ERB. If your prompt format needs escaping or quoting, do that before passing the local or inside the template.
