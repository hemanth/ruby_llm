After reading this guide, you will know:

* How to add RubyLLM to your `Chat` and `Message` models.
* Which records belong to your application and which RubyLLM manages internally.
* How persisted usage, tool calls, models, and batches behave.
* How to use custom or namespaced chat and message classes.

## Two Application Models

Your application owns the conversation: chats and messages. Those are the records where application concerns such as users, permissions, titles, content, retention, and attachments belong.

```ruby
# app/models/chat.rb
class Chat < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_chat

  belongs_to :user, optional: true
end

# app/models/message.rb
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_message
  has_many_attached :attachments

  validates :role, presence: true
end
```

That is the complete application-facing persistence setup. There is no `Model`, `ToolCall`, `UsageEntry`, or `Batch` model to add to `app/models`.

RubyLLM owns four supporting tables under the `ruby_llm_` prefix:

* `ruby_llm_models` for the model registry.
* `ruby_llm_tool_calls` for provider tool requests and their result links.
* `ruby_llm_usages` for retry- and cancellation-safe cost and usage tracking.
* `ruby_llm_batches` for provider-side batch state.

They are regular tables installed by migrations, not a Rails engine. Their record classes are implementation details; use the public RubyLLM APIs described below.

Their shared abstract base, `RubyLLM::ActiveRecord::Record`, inherits the default database connection. If your chats and messages use a secondary database, [configure the shared connection]({% link _advanced/rails-advanced-config.md %}#using-a-secondary-database) so all related tables stay together.

Do not validate message content as always present. Streaming creates an empty assistant message before content arrives, and a valid assistant message can contain tool calls without text.
{: .warning }

## Working with Persisted Chats

An `acts_as_chat` record exposes the regular chat API and persists transcript changes automatically:

```ruby
chat = Chat.create!(model: '{{ site.models.default_chat }}', user: current_user)

response = chat.ask("What is the capital of France?")

response.content          # => "The capital of France is Paris."
chat.messages.last.content
chat.messages.count       # => 2
```

The flow saves the user message, creates an assistant message, performs the provider operation, and fills the assistant message on success. If the operation fails before producing a useful message, RubyLLM removes the empty assistant record. Usage already incurred by a retry or cancellation remains in the usage ledger.

Use `add_message` to append an existing message without making a provider request. It accepts an attributes Hash, a `RubyLLM::Message`, or a persisted message record and returns a new record in this chat:

```ruby
chat.add_message(role: :user, content: "Keep this context for the next request.")
chat.add_message(previous_chat.messages.first)
```

The original record remains in its conversation. Copying transcript content does not create a new provider usage entry.

System instructions are messages too:

```ruby
chat.with_instructions("You are a concise Ruby expert.")
chat.with_instructions("Use short bullet points.", append: true)

chat.messages.where(role: :system)
```

Runtime-only settings such as fallbacks, tools, temperature, and callbacks live on the memoized `to_llm` chat. Reapply them after loading a fresh record, or define them in an [Agent]({% link _advanced/agents.md %}).

```ruby
chat.with_fallbacks("gpt-4.1-mini", "claude-haiku-4-5")
chat.with_temperature(0.2)
chat.ask("Summarize this conversation.")
```

## Model Storage

The chat belongs to a model record in RubyLLM's internal registry. The familiar readers still expose the provider-facing identity:

```ruby
chat = Chat.create!(model: '{{ site.models.openai_standard }}')

chat.model_id             # => "{{ site.models.openai_standard }}"
chat.provider             # => "openai"
chat.model                # => #<RubyLLM::ActiveRecord::Model ...>
chat.model.context_window
```

The registry itself is persisted internally. Query and refresh it through `RubyLLM.models`:

```ruby
RubyLLM.models.find('{{ site.models.openai_standard }}', provider: :openai)
RubyLLM.models.by_provider(:anthropic)
RubyLLM.models.refresh
```

There is no application-owned `Model` class or configurable registry model class. `acts_as_chat` defines the `model` association against RubyLLM's private record, preserving referential integrity without putting provider metadata in your application models.

On a message, `model` returns the ID from the last successful provider attempt. `model_info` looks up that ID in the registry:

```ruby
response.model           # => "{{ site.models.openai_standard }}"
response.model_info.name
```

Both readers return `nil` when the message has no recorded model. `model_info` also returns `nil` if the model is no longer in the registry.

If your message table has a `finish_reason` column, the record also exposes `stopped?`, `max_tokens?`, `tool_call_stop?`, and `content_filtered?`, with the same meanings as a plain message:

```ruby
response.reload.max_tokens? # => true if a token limit stopped the response
```

## Cost and Usage Tracking

Usage belongs to provider work, not to the transcript. RubyLLM therefore persists one normalized entry for every physical attempt, including automatic retries and cancelled streams that never produced a message.

```ruby
response = chat.ask("Explain Ruby fibers.")

response.tokens.input    # aggregate of the attempts that produced it
response.tokens.output
response.cost.total
chat.tokens.input         # includes retries and cancelled attempts
chat.cost.total           # includes retries and cancelled attempts
```

An entry links to the message it produced when there is one. A failed retry or a cancelled generation links only to the chat. `acts_as_chat` and `acts_as_message` add a `ruby_llm_usages` association over those rows, with `provider`, `model`, `status`, the token buckets, and `total_cost`, so you can sum spend in SQL. Each attempt also fires a `usage.ruby_llm` event. `chat.tokens` and `chat.cost` remain the value objects.

Token buckets and cost components are numeric columns in `ruby_llm_usages`; cost details are not stored as JSON. This freezes the price calculated when an attempt finishes and keeps the ledger suitable for database aggregation. The 2.0 runtime reads this ledger only; the 2.0 upgrade moves 1.16 message tokens into it before removing the old columns.

See [Cost and Usage Tracking]({% link _core_features/cost-and-usage-tracking.md %}) for entry statuses, incomplete totals, cancellation behavior, and instrumentation.

## Tools

Tools remain ordinary Ruby classes:

```ruby
class Weather < RubyLLM::Tool
  description "Gets current weather for a city"
  parameter :city

  def execute(city:)
    "Sunny in #{city}"
  end
end

chat.with_tools(Weather)
chat.ask("What is the weather in Berlin?")
```

RubyLLM persists provider tool requests internally and exposes public `RubyLLM::ToolCall` values from the message:

```ruby
message = chat.messages.find(&:tool_call?)
tool_call = message.tool_calls.values.first

tool_call.id
tool_call.name
tool_call.arguments
message.tool_results
```

The tool result itself is an application-owned message with the `tool` role. The internal tool-call row only preserves the provider request and links it to that result message.

## Batches

Submitting persisted chats automatically stores the provider batch state internally:

```ruby
chats = tickets.map do |ticket|
  Chat.create!(model: "claude-haiku-4-5").ask_later(ticket.body)
end

batch = RubyLLM.batch(chats)
BatchPollJob.perform_later(batch.id)
```

Look the batch up with the public value API from another process:

```ruby
batch = RubyLLM::Batch.find(batch_id)
batch.refresh

if batch.complete?
  batch.messages # appends each result to its persisted chat
end
```

No application `Batch` model is required. See [Batch Processing]({% link _advanced/batches.md %}) for polling and multi-round tool workflows.

## Attachments and Structured Output

With Active Storage on your message model, files passed to `ask` are persisted with the user message. In a controller action, check that an upload parameter is a file before passing it to `ask`:

```ruby
uploaded_file = params[:uploaded_file]
return head :bad_request unless uploaded_file.is_a?(ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile)

chat.ask("What is in this file?", with: uploaded_file)
```

An upload field can arrive as a String, Array, or Hash. Strong parameters permit Strings, so permitting the field does not prove that it contains a file. Validate every entry when accepting multiple uploads. See [Attachment Security]({% link _core_features/attachments.md %}#attachment-security) for how RubyLLM handles file paths and URLs.

You can also pass stored attachments that the current user is authorized to access:

```ruby
chat.ask("Compare these", with: project.documents)
```

Structured output is stored as JSON text in the application message content:

```ruby
class PersonSchema < Schematist::Schema
  string :name
  integer :age
end

response = chat.with_schema(PersonSchema).ask("Generate a person")
response.parsed                  # => {"name" => "Ada", "age" => 36}
response.content                 # => '{"name":"Ada","age":36}', what the row stores
chat.messages.last.parsed        # the same Hash, read back from the record
```

## Separate User and LLM Transcripts

The association passed to `acts_as_chat` is the transcript RubyLLM persists and sends to providers. Point it at a separate association when your user-visible transcript has different retention, compaction, moderation, or redaction rules:

```ruby
class Conversation < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :messages

  acts_as_chat messages: :llm_messages,
               message_class: "LlmMessage"
end
```

Your UI can render `conversation.messages` while RubyLLM works with `conversation.llm_messages`.

## Custom and Namespaced Models

Only the chat/message association needs mapping:

```ruby
class Conversation < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_chat messages: :chat_messages,
               message_class: "ChatMessage"
end

class ChatMessage < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_message chat: :conversation,
                  chat_class: "Conversation"
end
```

Specify the foreign key when Rails cannot infer it:

```ruby
module Support
  class Conversation < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_chat messages: :entries,
                 message_class: "Support::Entry",
                 messages_foreign_key: :conversation_id
  end

  class Entry < ApplicationRecord
    acts_as_message chat: :conversation,
                    chat_class: "Support::Conversation",
                    chat_foreign_key: :conversation_id
  end
end
```

Internal usage and tool-call references are polymorphic, so custom names and primary-key types do not require matching application models for RubyLLM's supporting records.

## Extending Your Models

Chats and messages remain normal ActiveRecord models:

```ruby
class Chat < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_chat

  belongs_to :user
  has_many :favorites, dependent: :destroy

  scope :recent, -> { order(updated_at: :desc) }

  def summary
    messages.last(2).map(&:content).join(" … ")
  end
end
```

Keep transcript content and application relationships in these models. Observe provider cost and usage through `usage.ruby_llm` instrumentation instead of copying RubyLLM's internal supporting models into your domain.
