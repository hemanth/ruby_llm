After reading this guide, you will know:

*   What the `ruby_llm:install` and `ruby_llm:chat_ui` generators create for you.
*   How RubyLLM's conventional app directory structure is organized.
*   How to generate starter agents, tools, and schemas.
*   How the generated chat UI renders messages, tool calls, and tool results.
*   How to customize model names and set up ActiveStorage.

RubyLLM's generators write models, migrations, controllers, jobs, and views into your application. Start with persistence, then add the chat UI or generate individual agents, tools, and schemas as you need them.

## Quick Setup with Generator

Run the install generator:

```bash
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:install
```

The generator:

- Creates application migrations and models for Chat and Message
- Creates one migration for RubyLLM's internal model, tool-call, usage, and batch tables
- Adds the `acts_as_chat` and `acts_as_message` declarations
- Installs ActiveStorage for file attachments
- Creates an initializer for provider configuration
- Creates conventional AI app directories

After running the generator:

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails ruby_llm:load_models
```

You can now create a persisted chat with `Chat.create!` and send a message with `chat.ask`.

### Install Generator Options

The generator uses Rails-like syntax for custom model names:

```bash
# Default - creates the application Chat and Message models
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:install

bin/rails generate ruby_llm:install chat:Conversation message:ChatMessage
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:install chat:Discussion message:DiscussionMessage

# Skip ActiveStorage if you don't need file attachments
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:install --skip-active-storage
```

The `name:ClassName` syntax follows Rails conventions - specify only what you want to customize.

For most apps, keep the default behavior (install ActiveStorage) so file attachments work out of the box. Use `--skip-active-storage` only when you're sure you won't send files to models.

## Adding a Chat UI

Run the chat UI generator to add controllers, views, and a background job:

```bash
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:chat_ui
```

The generator creates:

- **Controllers**: Create chats and enqueue message processing
- **Views**: Render messages and update them with Turbo Streams
- **Jobs**: Request AI responses in the background
- **Routes**: RESTful routes for chats and messages

Start your server and visit `http://localhost:3000/chats`.

The UI generator also supports custom model names:

```bash
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:chat_ui chat:Conversation message:ChatMessage
```

## Upgrading an Existing Integration

When a release changes the Rails schema, it ships `ruby_llm:upgrade` for applications on the previous release. The generator covers only the changes since that release, so upgrade one release at a time. See [Upgrading]({% link _reference/upgrading.md %}) for the current steps.

An application on RubyLLM 1.16 first installs 2.0 and follows the [2.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm/blob/v2.0.0/docs/_reference/upgrading.md).

## Conventional Directory Structure

RubyLLM's Rails generators establish a default app structure:

```text
app/
|-- agents/
|-- prompts/
|-- schemas/
`-- tools/
```

The install generator creates these directories with `.gitkeep` files so teams start from one shared convention.

These are conventions, not hard requirements:

- Agents, tools, and schemas can live anywhere in your app autoload paths.
- Prompt lookup convention: named agents automatically resolve `instructions.txt.erb` from the agent class name when the file exists.

For prompt lookup, RubyLLM uses class name conventions:

- `WorkAssistant` -> `app/prompts/work_assistant/instructions.txt.erb`
- `Admin::SupportAgent` -> `app/prompts/admin/support_agent/instructions.txt.erb`

See the [Agents guide]({% link _advanced/agents.md %}#default-instructions-prompt) for how agent instruction rendering works, or [Prompt Rendering]({% link _core_features/prompt-rendering.md %}) for direct `RubyLLM.render_prompt` usage.

## Rails Generators for Agents, Tools, and Schemas

Alongside `ruby_llm:install` and `ruby_llm:chat_ui`, Rails apps can generate starter classes for common AI building blocks:

```bash
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:agent Support
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:tool Weather
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:schema Product
```

What each generator creates:

- `ruby_llm:agent`: `app/agents/support_agent.rb` and `app/prompts/support_agent/instructions.txt.erb`
- `ruby_llm:tool`: `app/tools/weather_tool.rb` plus tool-specific chat UI partials under `app/views/messages/tool_calls` and `app/views/messages/tool_results`
- `ruby_llm:schema`: `app/schemas/product_schema.rb`

`ruby_llm:chat_ui` and `ruby_llm:tool` accept `--ui scaffold` or `--ui tailwind`. The default, `--ui auto`, picks Tailwind when your app has it. An existing app follows [Upgrading]({% link _reference/upgrading.md %}) instead of running `ruby_llm:install`.

If your chat UI uses a custom message model, pass the same mapping you gave `ruby_llm:chat_ui` so the partials land where the UI looks for them:

```bash
bin/rails generate ruby_llm:tool Weather message:ChatMessage
```

## Chat UI View Conventions

The generated chat UI follows one convention: each message partial uses the local that matches its partial name.

- `messages/_user.html.erb` gets `user`
- `messages/_assistant.html.erb` gets `assistant`
- `messages/_system.html.erb` gets `system`
- `messages/_tool.html.erb` gets `tool`
- `messages/_tool_calls.html.erb` gets `tool_calls`

This comes from Rails partial rendering: `render @chat.messages` calls `to_partial_path`, and Rails injects a local named after that partial.

For compatibility with model broadcasts (`broadcasts_to`), generated message partials also accept a `message` local as a fallback.

### Tool Call and Tool Result Partials

Tool-specific partials are generated under `app/views/messages/tool_calls` and `app/views/messages/tool_results`:

```text
app/views/messages/
|-- tool_calls/
|   |-- _default.html.erb
|   `-- _your_tool.html.erb
`-- tool_results/
    |-- _default.html.erb
    `-- _your_tool.html.erb
```

Locals passed to those partials:

- `messages/tool_calls/_your_tool.html.erb` receives `message` and `tool_call`
- `messages/tool_results/_your_tool.html.erb` receives `tool`

`ruby_llm:tool` creates `_your_tool.html.erb` files with the correct names so custom rendering hooks up automatically.

Using fixed locals keeps the templates dumb and predictable.

Turbo Stream templates used by the generated chat UI:

- `messages/create.turbo_stream.erb` resets the message form for `MessagesController#create`.

## Setting Up ActiveStorage

The generator automatically configures ActiveStorage for file attachments. If you skipped it during generation, add it manually:

```bash
bin/rails active_storage:install
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Then add to your Message model:

```ruby
# app/models/message.rb
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_message
  has_many_attached :attachments  # Required for file attachments
end
```

This `:attachments` association is only required on RubyLLM message records. The ActiveStorage attachments you pass to `with:` from your own models can use any name.

## Next Steps

*   [Persistence with acts_as]({% link _advanced/rails-persistence.md %}) - what the generated models do once they `acts_as_chat`.
*   [Streaming with Hotwire/Turbo]({% link _advanced/rails-streaming.md %}) - the streaming flow behind the generated chat UI.
*   [Agents]({% link _advanced/agents.md %}) - build on the generated agent and prompt conventions.
*   [Advanced Rails Configuration]({% link _advanced/rails-advanced-config.md %}) - provider overrides and custom contexts for the generated app.
