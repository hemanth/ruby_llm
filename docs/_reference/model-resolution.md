After reading this guide, you will know:

* The exact steps RubyLLM follows to turn a model name into a model and a provider.
* How aliases map a friendly name to a provider's versioned ID.
* How RubyLLM picks a provider when you don't name one.
* How provider-specific resolution works, including Bedrock regions and inference profiles.
* How to use a model the registry doesn't list, and what happens when resolution fails.

## Overview

Every entry point that takes a `model:` argument runs the same resolution. `RubyLLM.chat`, `RubyLLM.embed`, and `RubyLLM.paint` all hand the name to the registry, which returns two things: a `RubyLLM::Model` describing the model, and the provider instance that will serve it.

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: "claude-haiku-4-5", provider: :bedrock)
chat.model.id        # => "anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0"  (resolved from the alias)
chat.model.provider  # => "bedrock"
```

You gave a name; RubyLLM resolved it to a concrete model and chose a provider. The rest of this guide is the procedure behind that.

## The Resolution Procedure

Resolution takes a name and an optional provider, and runs in this order:

1. **Did you name a provider?** If you passed `provider:`, resolution is scoped to that provider. If not, RubyLLM searches every provider and chooses one by preference.
2. **Resolve aliases.** The name is looked up in the alias table and rewritten to the provider's versioned ID when a match exists.
3. **Look up the registry.** RubyLLM finds the model whose ID (or pre-alias name) matches in the [model registry]({% link _reference/models.md %}).
4. **Bypass the registry for unlisted models.** With `assume_model_exists: true` (or a local provider), RubyLLM skips the lookup and trusts the name you gave.
5. **Resolve the provider.** The provider comes from the matched model's `provider` field, or from the `provider:` you named.

If no model matches and you didn't ask RubyLLM to assume it exists, resolution raises `RubyLLM::ModelNotFoundError`.

## Aliases

An alias is a stable, friendly name that maps to a provider's exact, versioned model ID. Aliases live in `aliases.json` and are shaped as `friendly-name => { provider => versioned-id }`:

```json
{
  "claude-haiku-4-5": {
    "anthropic": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    "openrouter": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
    "bedrock": "anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0",
    "vertexai": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "azure": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
  }
}
```

When you name a provider, RubyLLM uses that provider's entry. Without a provider, it uses the first entry listed for the alias:

```ruby
RubyLLM.chat(model: "claude-haiku-4-5")                     # resolves to anthropic
RubyLLM.chat(model: "claude-haiku-4-5", provider: :bedrock) # resolves to anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
```

A name that isn't in the alias table is passed through unchanged, so exact model IDs always work.

## Resolving Without a Provider

When you don't name a provider, the same name can exist across several services, so RubyLLM has to choose one. It collects every registry model whose ID matches either the name you gave or its alias-resolved ID, then picks the most preferred provider.

Provider preference puts first-party providers ahead of the aggregators that resell their models:

| Rank | Providers |
| --- | --- |
| First-party | `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `mistral`, `cohere`, `perplexity`, `xai` |
| Cloud platforms | `vertexai`, `bedrock` |
| Aggregators and local | `openrouter`, `azure`, `hetzner`, `ollama_cloud`, `ollama`, `gpustack` |

Preference decides the winner when several providers carry the model. Anthropic, Vertex AI, Bedrock, and OpenRouter all serve `claude-haiku-4-5`, and Anthropic outranks the rest, so the bare name resolves to Anthropic:

```ruby
RubyLLM.chat(model: "claude-haiku-4-5").model.provider  # => "anthropic"
```

To pin a different provider, name it:

```ruby
RubyLLM.chat(model: "claude-opus-4", provider: :vertexai)
```

> Provider preference only breaks ties between providers that both carry the model. It never makes RubyLLM use a provider you haven't configured a key for, because a chat still needs that provider's credentials to run.
{: .note }

## Resolving With a Provider

When you pass `provider:`, RubyLLM resolves the alias for that provider, then finds the model whose ID matches the resolved ID (falling back to the raw name) for that provider only.

```ruby
RubyLLM.embed("hello", model: "text-embedding-3-small", provider: :openai)
```

### Bedrock Regions and Inference Profiles

Bedrock adds one more step. Its model IDs carry a region prefix and may require an inference profile, so before the registry lookup RubyLLM rewrites the ID for your configured `bedrock_region`:

```ruby
RubyLLM.configure { |config| config.bedrock_region = "us-east-1" }

chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: "claude-haiku-4-5", provider: :bedrock)
chat.model.id  # => "us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0"  (region prefix applied)
```

RubyLLM only applies the prefix when a matching regional model exists in the registry, and normalizes the inference-profile form from the model's metadata. See [Custom Endpoints and Unlisted Models]({% link _reference/custom-endpoints.md %}) for routing the same model through a different provider.

### Bedrock Converse and Mantle Endpoints

Bedrock serves models through two endpoints, and the model ID decides which one RubyLLM uses:

| Model ID | Endpoint | Wire format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` | `bedrock-mantle` | Anthropic Messages |
| `openai.gpt-oss-20b`, `google.gemma-4-31b` | `bedrock-mantle` | OpenAI Responses |
| `qwen.qwen3-coder-next`, `zai.glm-5` | `bedrock-mantle` | OpenAI Chat Completions |
| `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` | `bedrock-runtime` | Converse |
| `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`, `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` | `bedrock-runtime` | Converse |

RubyLLM refreshes both catalogs, so the registry records which endpoint serves each model and routing reads that record rather than guessing from the ID. The two catalogs overlap and disagree: mantle spells some Converse models differently (`qwen.qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` against Converse's `qwen.qwen3-next-80b-a3b`) and lists models Converse has never heard of.

Claude models speak the Anthropic Messages API on mantle. The rest of the mantle catalog speaks one of the two OpenAI surfaces: the Gemma 4 and GPT-OSS models answer on Responses, and everything else answers on Chat Completions. Both endpoints use the same AWS credentials and are signed with SigV4, so nothing changes in your configuration.

For a model the registry doesn't list, RubyLLM falls back to reading the ID: an un-versioned `vendor.model` ID with no `:` version suffix, no date stamp, and no region prefix goes to mantle. A bare `anthropic.` ID always goes to mantle, because Converse only ever serves Claude under a dated and versioned ID.

Point `bedrock_mantle_api_base` at a different host to override the mantle endpoint, the same way `bedrock_api_base` overrides the Converse one.

```ruby
RubyLLM.chat(model: 'openai.gpt-oss-20b', provider: :bedrock).ask('Hello')
```

## Models the Registry Doesn't List

New releases, custom fine-tunes, and private deployments won't be in the registry. Set `assume_model_exists: true` to skip the registry lookup and use the name as-is. You must name a provider, since there is no registry entry to infer one from:

```ruby
chat = RubyLLM.chat(
  model: ENV.fetch("CUSTOM_CHAT_MODEL"),
  provider: :openai,
  assume_model_exists: true
)
```

RubyLLM then builds a synthetic `RubyLLM::Model` with assumed capabilities (`function_calling`, `streaming`, `vision`, `structured_output`) and a metadata warning, because it can't know the real ones:

```ruby
chat.model.capabilities  # => ["function_calling", "streaming", "vision", "structured_output"]
chat.model.metadata      # => { warning: "Assuming model exists, capabilities may not be accurate" }
```

You are responsible for using only the features the model actually supports. The same flag works on `RubyLLM.embed`, `RubyLLM.paint`, and `with_model`.

> Local providers like Ollama and GPUStack assume models exist automatically. You can pull and run any model name without registering it first, and you don't need to pass the flag. Ollama Cloud and Hetzner do the same, because their catalogs change faster than the registry. So does Azure, because you name your own deployments.

## When Resolution Fails

If nothing matches and you didn't assume existence, RubyLLM raises `RubyLLM::ModelNotFoundError` with guidance to refresh the registry:

```ruby
RubyLLM.chat(model: unknown_model_id)
# => RubyLLM::ModelNotFoundError: Unknown model: ...
#    If the model exists at the provider, refresh the registry with
#    `RubyLLM.models.refresh`.
```

A real but newly released model usually means your registry is stale. Refresh it from the published catalog and your configured providers:

```ruby
RubyLLM.models.refresh
```

See [Model Registry]({% link _reference/models.md %}#refreshing-the-registry) for refreshing in applications and Rails. If the model genuinely isn't in any catalog, use `assume_model_exists: true` instead.

## Next Steps

* [Model Registry]({% link _reference/models.md %}) - explore, filter, and inspect the registry.
* [Custom Endpoints and Unlisted Models]({% link _reference/custom-endpoints.md %}) - point a provider at a custom host and use unlisted models.
* [Custom Providers and Protocols]({% link _reference/custom-providers.md %}) - teach RubyLLM about a service it doesn't know.
